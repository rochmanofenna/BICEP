# BICEP: Brownian-Inspired Computationally Efficient Parallelization Pipeline

## Overview
**BICEP** is a GPU-optimized parallel processing pipeline inspired by Brownian motion and quantum processing, designed to reduce computational overhead and enhance adaptability in neural networks.

My idea centers on using a Brownian motion inspired, controlled randomness model to dynamically determine bit states in a wat that emulates quantum like efficiency. By structuring this randomness as a graph, each node represents a bit state influenced by prior states, enabling one to track patterns and control randomness adaptively. This is This is where GPU parallelization comes in: by running multiple Brownian paths in parallel on the GPU, each path can explore different bit-state combinations simultaneously, achieving a dense mapping akin to qubit superposition. The goal is to use bit mapping techniques on GPUs to store and process multiple values per bit, leveraging the efficiency of parallel computation to speed up data processing and reduce computational complexity. By exploring fields like stochastic computing, reservoir computing, quantum-inspired algorithms, and RNNs/Markov chains, I aim to refine elements of efficiency, state handling, and memory without compromising the original concept of the approach.
